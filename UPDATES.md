#### Updates on 10/02/2023

1. Nothing happens when I click on a “circle i” icon. Similarly for the “…” icon for number of stations. - Hovering text is already there, made it quicker and changed the pointer while hoverin on i icons
2. Though I can now change the search radius to less than 10 miles, the resulting data comes from a much wider radius, possibly only restricted in the latitude direction? - There was a small formula mistake in the previous one, should give the correct ones now.
3. Important: The unit for Temperature should not be included as part of the values because then the attribute is treated as categorical rather than numeric. Instead, the attribute properties should specify °F as the unit. (The plugin can do this through the API.) - removed this " °F" added to the temperature data and added it to the labels in the top of the tabular structure.
4. Provide defaults for both the averaging time period and the maximum number of sensors. I would suggest 5 for the latter. - Average minutes are set to 30 minutes by default and maximum sensors to 5.
5. If the user has not changed the averaging time period, adjust it dynamically based on their date range; e.g. if the time period is 1 day, the averaging time period might be 10 minutes, and if the user changes the date range to more than a week, it might be 1 hour. - Done, also added case if nothing was in the defined range.
6. Add units for Temperature. Added in the fix for point #3.
